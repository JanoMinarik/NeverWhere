\chapter{Graphic Processing Units}
The strong need on computational performance in scientific and engineering calculations led to use of heterogeneous computing, using GPU and other accelerators as co-processors for arithmetic intensive data-parallel workloads \cite{stone10}. This leads to development of various API. Most notable are OpenCL and CUDA from NVIDIA.

\section{OpenCL}
OpenCL is an industry standard for task-parallel and data-parallel heterogeneous computing for a variety of modern CPUs, GPUs and other microprocessor designs\cite{stone10}.
